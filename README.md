To run this program, you can use the following command to read input from a file:

python my_program.py --input my_input_file.txt

Alternatively, you can use standard input by omitting the --input argument:

echo "a two-story pink house with a white fence" | python my_program.py

You can also read input from a URL by specifying the --url argument:

python my_program.py --url http://www.example.com/input.txt
Note that you will need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your own API key, which you can obtain by creating an account on the OpenAI website and generating a key for the DALL-E API.
