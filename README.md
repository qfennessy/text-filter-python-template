To run this program, you can use the following command to read input from a file and specify the API key as a command-line argument:

python my_program.py --input my_input_file.txt --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

Alternatively, you can use standard input by omitting the --input argument:

echo "a two-story pink house with a white fence" | python my_program
